# VRC-Panel-Van
A basic VRChat map for lightmap testing and whatnot.
It's like-- the inside of a panel van. Maybe you got kidnapped or smth I don't know.
It's a panel van just because that limits the scope of the environment

# External Dependencies
This project includes paid prefabs! I'm too lazy to read all the licenses, so I'm playing it safe and not including any of them. However, I will list what they are in case you need them.

It's uploaded on my account. It'll be public at a later date, after it feels more complete and it has a proper thumbnail.

# License

### **TL;DR** Don't resell these assets for a profit (modifications are yours and not included), and if the official VRChat upload is still functional, please don't try to usurp it.

So, Licencing. I've uh, never done it before.
I'd love to do some sort of CC thing, but I have a stipulation that I care about that I don't think Creative Commons can cover, so instead of taking the time to find the proper existing license made my smart people, I'm going to make my own real quick. When it comes to my non-watertight wording, we're going on the honor system here; It would mean a lot to me if the spirit of this license was respected rather than to the letter.

These files are public! The source is available for free. Go ahead and download this and import it into Unity (permitting that Unity decides to work that day). Mess around, poke the code, snatch assets for other projects, that's up to you. 

It's not entirely open though. My stipulation is that **I don't want you reuploading the project to VRChat with minimal changes, as that defeats the purpose of the official upload.** Have fun with the assets, but please respect the integrity of the official upload. However, if the official upload becomes substantially broken or unavialable in some way, that stipulation is void.

Oh, and please, don't resell this for a profit. It's free now and should remain free. If people want these assets, they should be directed here instead of a marketplace. I don't know what "Fair Use" means in full detail but if you modified what you're selling sufficiently, this is void. Yeah that's also on the honor system too. I hope that's fair.

Lastly, I'd like to note that I'm only like 95% sure that all the sound effects and whatnot in use are properly licensed. I didn't pirate them, but I also wasn't super diligent when it came to making sure everything was Creative Commons or similar, so be careful where you use this lol.

Hope that makes sense. Have fun!
